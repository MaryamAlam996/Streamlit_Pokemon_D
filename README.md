## Catch your Pokemon

This interactive web application allows users to explore and compare Pokemon data. The app is built using Streamlit and displays visualisations of Pokemon stats comparison.

### Features
 - Use the input field to select which Pokemon you want to catch, just type in the Pokedex number of your favourite
 - The top stats and an image of the Pokemon will display once you have made a selection
 - Stats comparison - switch to the comparison tab to see how your chosen Pokemon compares to a selection of 5 other Pokemon, selected at random
### Data Sources
 - Pokemon data: CSV provided as part of the brief (pokemon.csv)
 - Pokemon images: dynamically fetched from [Pok√©mon Assets](https://github.com/HybridShivam/Pokemon/)
### Data Cleanup
To optimise the user experience and application speed, some columns not used for the display and comparison were dropped from the original dataset. Similarly, Pokemon with no abilities were dropped from the original dataset.<br>
<br>
For the sake of data consistency, an index has been added to the dataset.<br>
<br>
A column for image url was created, to streamline fetching the images for user requested Pokemon.
